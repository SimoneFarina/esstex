ESS LaTeX Beamer Style
=================

# esstex-template.tex


* I intend to develop this beamer style file in order to make the ESS presenatation by using LaTeX, because I have my own customized beamer template and I don't have MS office in Debian machine. There are an existent LaTeX beamer styles, but they use pdflatex, I prefer to use a legacy method to generate pdf file (latex, xdvi, dvi2pdf, and so on)


* Please loot at other ess latex activites on bitbucket :

 * https://bitbucket.org/europeanspallationsource/ess-latex
 * https://bitbucket.org/europeanspallationsource/ess-latex-templates

# Makefile for this

* There is a good Makefile for LaTeX, one should check the following site:
 * https://github.com/shiblon/latex-makefile

* Note that, in order to work with esstex-template.tex, one should use latex instead of pdflatex
